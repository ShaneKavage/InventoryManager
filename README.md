# InventoryManager

This is a C++ based program for managing a grocery store's inventory. It is extensible enough to allow for any type of inventory management, but my team has decided to base it on a Grocery Store. Inventory Manager's focus is from a corporate view point, but does offer a customer cart and client side transactions.  This is for our Advanced Object Oriented Design Class.
